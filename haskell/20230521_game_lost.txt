look                       -- look around again.
take OBJECT_NAME           -- take object (into your inventory).
use OBJECT_NAME on CONTEXT -- use object on diffrent object or context
investigate OBJECT_NAME    -- investigate object's details.
cast SPELL SPELL_COMPONENT -- to cast a spell using correct component.
quit                       -- to end the game and quit.
