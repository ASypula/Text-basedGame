You are a wizard apprentice who failed their final exams, 
thus General University of magic put you in a deadly dungeon.

Were you to escape, Wizard Council would let you retake exams...
Available commands are:

instructions               -- to see these instructions.
look                       -- look around again.
take OBJECT_NAME           -- take object (into your inventory).
investigate OBJECT_NAME    -- investigate object's details.
cast SPELL SPELL_COMPONENT -- to cast a spell using correct component.
quit                       -- to end the game and quit.

At the center of the large room there is a magical bridge, covering an acid pool. Congrats, this obstacle is not a problem any more.
On the north side of the late acid pool there are passages north and west. On the south side there is a passage south.
On the north side there is a skeleton wearing a nightcap. It lays in a very comfortable natural position, as if it just layed to eternal sleep here.
Over the pool fly some weird glowing bugs. They look similar to fireflies.
