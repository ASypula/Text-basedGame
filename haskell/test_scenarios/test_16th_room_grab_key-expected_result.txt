You are a wizard apprentice who failed their final exams, 
thus General University of magic put you in a deadly dungeon.

Were you to escape, Wizard Council would let you retake exams...
Available commands are:

instructions               -- to see these instructions.
look                       -- look around again.
take OBJECT_NAME           -- take object (into your inventory).
investigate OBJECT_NAME    -- investigate object's details.
cast SPELL SPELL_COMPONENT -- to cast a spell using correct component.
quit                       -- to end the game and quit.

You enter a vast, cluttered room. You have to maneuver between shelves, crates and tables to move around.
Exits are on the west and north wall.
The room is filled with jars, bottles and glass aparature.
Only one of the bottles appears to have something in it.
As you look around the room you notice something shiny between floor tiles, but you cannot grab it with your fingers.
Some sort of jewellery? Or maybe a key?
