You are a wizard apprentice who failed their final exams, thus General University of magic put you in deadly dungeon.
Were you to escape, Wizard Council would let you retake exams.

It might be cool to have multiple solutions to problems. 

How to end game:
1. Most obvious - Bypass beast guarding the dungeon exit (kill spell with wolfsbane component) 
2. Secret - Bypass beast (use magnet to steal its enchanted school staff badge and then cast sleep on it)
3. Secret - Reach and open the trapdoor from the beginning of the dungeon (open with cast(open, rusty key) and reach it using jump potion

Endings:
1. You did it. You made it out alive. The exams surely can't be worse than this. However there is something that might... 
    The High University of Magic was not thrilled with an idea of student actually getting out of their deadly dungeon. 
    The High Wizards were aspetially irytated about the loss of their favourite beast. You will have to settle this with Dean of Magic himself.
    You escaped the deadly dungeon only to start much more frightening battle - writing an official letter.

2. You did it. You made it out alive. You used your wits to bypass the beast without fighting it and aquired authentic badge of High University of Magic staff member.
    You reatake you exams and pass them with flying colors. You can not stop thinking about that badge. What if it became trully yours? What of you joined the staff?
    The cursed badge slowly takes over you and before you realise it your body is twisted into this new beastly form.
    To your surprise you retain your senses and consciousness. Teaching and research at University feels amaizing, although you sometimes wish you had human hands again.

3. You did it. You made it out alive. There wasn't even a need of fighting the deadly beast. The escape through the trapdoor had some unforseen consequences though...
    The University's magical database system was not capable of processing your way of escaping and spectacularry collapsed.
    Personal data of many wizards and apprentices were lost. With the new-arisen chaos there is no way the High Wizard Council will let you continue studies.
    Good think that your data was also lost. You can change your name, bluff your way through and retake the whole year. You seem like you need that anyway.

Outro:
    Thank you for playing our videogame. [If we feel brave] We sincerely wish you a great day and a tasty coffe.

Rooms:

1. Exit - On the north side of a room you see big golden door with "exit" engraved on them. Unfortunately it is guarded by a beast. 
    It has a body of a lion but is definitely bigger than a normal animal. The head belongs to deceptively beautiful woman with blue eyes and cruel smile.
    The beast rises its double scorpion tail as if already prepared to attack.
    The only slightly amusing thing about it is a big, metal, old-fashioned school staff badge attached to its fur.
    The room is filled with skeletons in wizard apprentice robes.
    You can still back off to the south.
    [you can cast power word kill on it to bypass it or use magnet on a badge and then cast sleep]
    With the beast not being a problem anymore you touch golden door. You take a deep breath and finally open them, stepping out of this nightmare.
2. Beneath the trapdoor - First room. Walls are smooth. On the ceiling far above there is a trapdoor, you were tossed here through.
    There is a skeleton in wizard robes and a journal*1.
    There is a slightly open door on the east wall.
    [one of the endings below. This one is more secret so don't put those brackets in hints]
        [you can use jump potion to jump to trapdoor]
        [you can open a trapdoor using open with rusty key]
3. Junk Room - The room is covered by unnatural magical darkness, your lantern cannot illuminate.
    You stumble upon various objects scattered on the floor, but there is no way to distinguish whether any of them may be useful.
    By touch you find passage north east and west.
    [when you cast light, you can take useful objects here]
    rope*8
4. Acid Pool - A the center of the large room there is an acid pool. It expands from east to west wall and is too wide to jump over it.
    Over the pool fly some weird glowing bugs*2. They look similar to fireflies.
    On the north side there is a skeleton wearing a nightcap*10. It lays in a very comfortable natural position, as if it just layed to eternal sleep here.
    On the north side of the acid pool there are passages north and west. On the south side there is a passage south.
    [You can traverse the acid pool by using jump potion*9]
    [you can take nightcap from northen side or by using grab spell]
14. Small Dragon - The corridor takes a turn here. You could go south or west but in the corner lies a dragonling. 
    It guards a pile of student's robes, books and cheat sheets and looks rather angry. Walls around it are covered in burn marks.
    [To unlock this path cast sleep on a dragon]
    When dragon asleep: Little dragonling is sleeping on the pile of students' robes books and cheat sheets. 
    [You can take cheat sheet*6]
    [You can take book fragment*12]
    [You can take beer*x]
15. Soot room - Rather big room with soot spots. 
    There is a soot covered skeleton. Beside it, there is a partially burned journal*3
    There are passages north and south.
16. Alchemist room  - [add room description here]. There is something shiny [key*5] between floor tiles, but you cannot grab it with your fingers.
    Some sort of jewellery? Or maybe a key?
    Passages west and north.
    Jars*4, key*5 [you can obtain key by casting grab or by use(magnet, key) or grab spell]
    potion*9
5. Machinery - [this room is accessible only by opening door to it with cast(open, key)]
    The room is filled with techno-magic machinery. It is not considered difficult magic, but you overslept that exam and failed it anyway.
    There is a control panel but it is blocked by a 4 digit code password (use enter(password_xxxx). command). On the back of it very old dusty sticky note*11 is attached.
    There is a door on the east wall.
    [the code is 1988 which is a year of Morris worm. There is also a note with the specific year in room 13]
    [the machinery creates magical bridge over acid pool thus unlocking that room]
    [it also unlocks path to 13 room]
6. Corridor - Corridor filled with goblin skeletons. Looks like some mage defeated them, you can still sense magic in the air.
    One of the goblins holds curious looking magnet*7
    The corridor leads north. There is also an opening on the east side.
7. Puzzle room - This room has weird magical sigils on the walls. 
    You recognise them as symbols allowing to cast specific transmutation spells without components, but can't recall which.
    There is a comedicly big journal*13 here. Under it there is squished little skeleton wearing small wizard hat.
    There are 5 pedestals in a line, numbered from 1 (most left) to 5 (most right). [You can put blocks on pedestals using put(color, position)]
    In the room there are also 5 blocks in different colors - red, green, blue, purple and orange. The red, blue and purple are small. Green and orange are bigger.
    [correct solution is O R P B G]
    [to solve the riddle you have to set right sizes to blocks and put them on correct pedestals. This unlocks path to room 8]
    The only visible exit is on the west wall.
    [after solving the puzzle the secret east door is unraveled tho]
8. Undead student - The hidden room is filled with books and oracle orbs. It is illuminated by mistical blue light.
    In the centre of the room stands a skeleton wearing very old tattered hat with "Maggus" on it.
    "Oh another lost student." it says. "Don't be afraid, I was once just like you - a lost student." 
    "I believe we can help each other. I found many secrets in this hidden library but unfortunately became bound to it."
    "I know a spell to defeat the beast but it is no use to me. I will share it with you, but first you need to bring me... a beer. As a memorial of my past."
    "Some students sneak beer in here, it should be possible to find some."
    [next visit] "So, do you have it?" Its empty eye sockets look at you menacingly.
    [after use beer skeleton or similar] "Ah it's been a while. I probably can't taste it now though... "
    "Anyway the spell name is power_word_kill and the component is a bunch of wolfsbane."
13. Storage - Door to this room is locked [standard Open spell unlocks it].
    Inside there is a skeleton sitting in a corner. Next to it lays a broken jar with some dead insects inside.
    Apart from that, the room is mostly filled with empty crates.
    There is a ripped journal*15 here.
    The door is on the south wall.
12. Evil roots - Room is locked by technomagic door [code in Machinery or rusty key open spell unlocks it]
    The room is very dark and smells of dirt and herbs. After even one step in you get scratched by thorns. Let's hope that wasn't anything poisonous.
    There is no way to safely explore this room without magical light.
    [after light spell is casted here]
    You see many normal and magical herbs and flowers growing here. The wolfsbane*16 catches your eye.
11. Long corridor - You are in a long corridor going east and west. In the middle it has two doors in front of each other.
    The north door is bigger and clearly locked using techno-magic. The south door looks normal but is still locked by a regular lock.
    The corridor is stained with soot in some places. 
    There is a ripped page*14 here.
10. Death ahead - There is a door on the north wall, however it is covered in many warning messages written using chalk, soot, ink and even blood.
    There is also a long corridor going east and another corridor going south.

Objects:
0. Lantern - Your good trusty lantern. You will need it untill you finally get a hold of light spell.
1. Old journal - "I found the exit! It is to the north, but fierce beast guides it.
    I'm gonna await next student who's gonna fail their exams and team up with them against the beast."
2. Fireflies - Small, light-emitting beetles. Their light might not be very strong, but If reinforced...
3. Burned journal - "[illegible] is giving me a hard time. I know the [illegible] spell would be a save way to deal with it, 
    however casting "grab" on it's tail would be funnier. Besides I don't have nightcap for [illegible] spell"
4. jar - Empty, a bit dusty jar.
5. key - Small iron key fit more for pendants than doors or chests. [spell component]
6. cheet sheet - "light spell: prons: easy, efficient, stays for a long time; cons: requires rare component"
    "grab spell: prons: nearly anything will do as a component. Just needs to be long; cons: beasts hate it for some reason. It is nearly impossible to cast it near them"
    "sleep spell: prons: usefull to aviod combat; cons: doesn't work on school staff fore some reason, If casted on self, you cannot wake up."
7. magnet - Medium size magnet with carved initials.
8. rope - old tattered rope. You wouldn't trust it to hold you weight. But it's quite long. 
    I can't throw it too far but maybe I can grab something with a help of some spell?
9. potion - You recognise it from your alchemy classes (the only ones that you passes). This is a Far Jump Potion. You can use it to jump very far, but only once.
10. nightcap - It doesn't look too fashionable, but kind of comfy. [spell component]
11. sticky note - "The code is year of the Worm Spell disaster."
12. book fragment - "There is more powerfull variant of "open" spell that uses rusty key as a component, which is proven to..." 
    The words "more", "powerful" and "rusty" are underlined and next to them there is a handwritten note "Dumb as hell".
13. big journal - "I finally decoded the runes on the wall. Some of them allow casting grow and shrink spells without components 
    (cast(grow, object). and cast(shrink, object).).
    Others form some kind of a riddle. Good thing that I listened during rune theory lectures. It roughly translates as:
        1. Red is the same size as Orange.
        2. Red has both small and big neighbour.
        3. Purple is small.
        4. Red and blue are both next to their colour mix.
        5. Their size has symmetry about the middle block.
        6. Blue doesn't have any small blocks on it's right.
        7. Red is more to the left than green is."
14 ripped page - "The Open spell is giving me a hard time. I have no idea how to cast it's a more powerful version so northen door is inaccessible to me.
    I might have a chance with southern door but I have to be careful anyway. With how sloppy my spellcasting is, the door might as well lock again just after I get in.
    I have to move on so I'm going to risk it. Wish me luck."
15 ripped journal - "My Open spell was so bad my spell component shattered. I am stuck here. I didn't even have a chance to try to enter the code to that machinery.
    I wasn't very good at History of Magic but I think Morris Worm Spell disaster was in 1998 or 1988."
16. A solid bunch of wolfsbane. Good that you aren't a warewolf.
x. Beer - You are a student who failed an exam. There must be beer somewhere in the game.
