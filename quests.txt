You are a wizard apprentice who failed their final exams, thus General University of magic put you in deadly dungeon.
Were you to escape, Wizard Council would let you retake exams.

It might be cool to have multiple solutions to problems. [In this version there are singular solutions and not for every problem xd]

How to end game:
1. Bypass beast guarding the dungeon exit (somehow)
2. Reach and open the trapdoor from the beginning of the dungeon (open with cast(open, rusty key) and reach it... somehow )

Rooms:
There shouldn't be empty rooms. Room should contain at least one usefull object, preferably also a puzzle.

1. Exit - It is guarded by bloodthirsty beast
2. Beneath the trapdoor - First room. Walls are smooth. On the ceiling far above there is trapdoor, you were tossed here through.
    There is a skeleton in wizard robes and a journal*1.
    There is a slightly open door on the east wall.
3. Junk Room - The room is covered by unnatural magical darkness, your lantern cannot illuminate.
    You stumble upon various object scattered on the floor, but there is no way to distinguish whether any of them may be usefull.
    By touch you find passage north east and west.
    [when you cast light you can find usefull objects here]
    magnet*7
4. Acid Pool - A the center of the large room there is acid pool. It expands from east to west wall and is to wide too jump over it.
    Over the pool fly some weird glowing bugs*2. They look similar to fireflies.
    On the south side of the pool there is a rope*8
    on the north side of acid pool there are passages north and west. On the south side there is passage south.
14. Small Dragon - A dragonling is blocking the corridor. It guards a pile of student's robes, books and cheat sheets. It looks rather angry.
    [To unlock this path cast sleep on a dragon]
    When dragon asleep: Little dragonling is sleeping on the pile of students' robes books and cheat sheets. There is passage west and south.
    [You can take cheat sheet*6]
15. Soot room - Rather big room with soot spots. [perhaps statue moving puzzle here?]
    There is soot covered skeleton. Beside it there is partially burned journal*3
    There are passages north and south.
16. Alchemist room  - [add room description here]. There is something shiny [key*5] between floor tiles, but you cannot grab it with your fingers.
    Passages west and north.
    Jars*4, key*5 [you can obtain key by casting grab or by use(magnet, floor) or smth similar]


Objects:
1. Old journal - "I found the exit! It is to the north, but fierce beast guides it.
    I'm gonna await next student who's gonna fail their exams and team up with them against the beast."
2. Fireflies - [They can be picked up if jar in inventory. Spell component.] [add description here] 
3. Burned journal - "[illegible] is giving me a hard time. I know the [illegible] spell would be a save way to deal with it, 
    however casting "grab" on it's tail would be funnier. Besides I don't have nightcap for [illegible] spell"
4. jar - [needed to take firefly, perhaps can contain something else if multiple jars] [add description]
5. key - Small iron key fit more for pendants than doors or chests. [spell component]
6. cheet sheet - [add description of some cool spell here] [add light spell description]
7. magnet - [add description here] [usable object]
8. rope - old tattered rope. You wouldn't trust it to hold you weight. [spell component]
x. Beer - [the hero is a student who failed an exam. There must be beer somewhere in the game]


To Do:
[add way to overcome acid puddle]
[add nightcap somewhere]
[add info about rusty key (probably next to closed door on some cheat sheet)]
[add info about grab spell but past the dragon or acid pool]
[create some small moving block puzzle? sokoban? move command???]

[create game winning scenarios]


Commands:
look                    - look around. Get room description
look(smth)              - investigate specyfic object. Get that object detailed description ex. read spell cheat sheet
go(dir) or n, s, w, e   - Move between rooms. Perhaps go(room_name) would automaticly move you to specyfic room if possible?
take(smth)              - add smth to inventory
inventory               - list items in inventory
?use(smth1, smth2)       - use something on something ex. use(key, acid) to make key rusty



Spells:
You can cast spells to solve problems. To cast spell you need appropriate component. Player is not given spell list in the tutorial. They have to learn them in game.
syntax:
    cast(SPELLNAME, COMPONENT)
You usually can guess the component, but there will be spell cheat sheets in the dungeon (left by previous unlucky students).
spell list (placeholder components):
    cast(light, firefly)
    cast(open, rusty key)/ cast(open, key)  - wersion with rusty key is more powerfull and can open any door (perhaps also trapdoor in Beneth the trapdoor #2) 
    cast(grab, rope)                        - takes something from afar 
    cast(sleep, nightcap)
