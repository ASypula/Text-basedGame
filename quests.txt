You are a wizard apprentice who failed their final exams, thus General University of magic put you in deadly dungeon.
Were you to escape, Wizard Council would let you retake exams.

It might be cool to have multiple solutions to problems. 

How to end game:
1. Bypass beast guarding the dungeon exit (kill spell or magnet + sleep spell)
2. Reach and open the trapdoor from the beginning of the dungeon (open with cast(open, rusty key) and reach it using jump potion

Rooms:

1. Exit - It is guarded by a bloodthirsty beast. [manticore with school staff badge made of metal]
    [you can cast power word kill on it to bypass it or use magnet on a badge and then cast sleep]
2. Beneath the trapdoor - First room. Walls are smooth. On the celling far above there is trapdoor, you were tossed here through.
    There is a skeleton in wizard robes and a journal*1.
    There is a slightly open door on the east wall.
    [one of the endings below. Thi one is more secret so don't put those brackets in hints]
        [you can use jump potion to jump to trapdoor]
        [you can open a trapdoor using open with rusty key]
3. Junk Room - The room is covered by unnatural magical darkness, your lantern cannot illuminate.
    You stumble upon various object scattered on the floor, but there is no way to distinguish whether any of them may be usefull.
    By touch you find passage north east and west.
    [when you cast light you can take usefull objects here]
    rope*8
4. Acid Pool - A the center of the large room there is acid pool. It expands from east to west wall and is to wide to jump over it.
    Over the pool fly some weird glowing bugs*2. They look simillar to fireflies.
    On the north side there is a skeleton wearing a nightcap*10. I lays in a very comfortable natural position, as if it just layed to eternal sleep here.
    on the north side of acid pool there are passages north and west. On the south side there is passage south.
    [You can traverse the acid pool by using jump potion*9]
    [you can take nightcap from northen side or by using grab spell]
14. Small Dragon - A dragonling is blocking the corridor. It guards a pile of student's robes, books and cheat sheets. It looks rather angry.
    [To unlock this path cast sleep on a dragon]
    When dragon asleep: Little dragonling is sleeping on the pile of students' robes books and cheat sheets. There is passage west and south.
    [You can take cheat sheet*6]
    [You can take book spinnet*12]
15. Soot room - Rather big room with soot spots. [perhaps statue moving puzzle here?]
    There is soot covered skeleton. Beside it there is partially burned journal*3
    There are passages north and south.
16. Alchemist room  - [add room description here]. There is something shiny [key*5] between floor tiles, but you cannot grab it with your fingers.
    Some sort of jewellery? Or maybe a key?
    Passages west and north.
    Jars*4, key*5 [you can obtain key by casting grab or by use(magnet, key) or smth simillar]
    potion*9
5. Machinery - [this room is accessible only by opening door to it with cast(open, key)]
    The room is filled with techno-magic machinery. It is not considered difficult magic, but you oversleept that exam and failed it anyway.
    There is a control panel but it is blocked by a 4 digit code password (use enter(xxxx). command). On the back of it very old dusty sticky note*11 is attatched.
    [the code is 1988 which is a year of Morris worm. There is a note with specyfic year somewhere else on the level]
    [the machinery creates magical bridge over acid pool thus unlocking that room]
    [it also unlocks 13 or 12 room]
6. Corridor - Corridor filled with sleeping goblins and skeletons. You must move very carefully between them.
    One of the goblins holds curious looking magnet*7
    the corridor leads north. There is also an opening on the east side.
7. Puzzle room - This room has weird magical sigils on the walls. 
    You recognise them as symbols allowing to do specyfic transmutation spells here, but can't recall which.
    There is a comedicly big journal*13 here. Under it there is squished little skeleton wearing small wizard hat.
    There are 5 pedestals in a line, numbered from 1 (most left) to 5 (most right). [You can put blocks on pedestals using put(color, position)]
    In the room there are also 5 blocks in diffrent colors - red, green, blue, purple and orange. The red, blue and purple are small. Green and orange are bigger.
    [correct solution is O R p B G]
    [to solve the riddle you have to set right sizes to blocks and put them on correct pedestals. This unlocks path to room 8]
8. Undead student - [add some cool description of a small liblary here]
    [there is undead skeleton here. It wears very old tattered hat with "Maggus" on it.]
    [It is an undead student who achieved immortality but they become bounded to this place.]
    [Undead student can grant you a wish after you bring them beer. You can get a spell to kill the fierce beast.]
    [spell might be power_word_kill because it is long and hard to guess and it is DnD reference xd]
13. [TODO] - beer*x here, but blocked somehow. Safe perhaps? room is locked.
12. [TODO] - second magnet opportunity? item to unlock beer. Room is locked by technomagic barrier [code in Machinery unlocks it]
11. another corridor xd. 13 south. 12 north.
10. [todo] - north to the beast guardian room. east goes long corridor.


Objects:
1. Old journal - "I found the exit! It is to the north, but fierce beast guides it.
    I'm gonna await next student who's gonna fail their exams and team up with them against the beast."
2. Fireflies - [They can be picked up if jar in inventory. Spell component.] [add description here] 
3. Burned journal - "[illegible] is giving me a hard time. I know the [illegible] spell would be a save way to deal with it, 
    however casting "grab" on it's tail would be funnier. Besides I don't have nightcap for [illegible] spell"
4. jar - [needed to take firefly, perhaps can contain something else if multiple jars] [add description]
5. key - Small iron key fit more for pendants than doors or chests. [spell component]
6. cheet sheet - "light spell: prons: easy, efficient, stays for a long time; cons: requires life component"
    "grab spell: prons: nearly anything will do as a component. Just needs to be long. Even long shoelace will do; cons: beasts hate it for some reason. It is nearly impossible to cast it near them"
    "sleep spell: prons: usefull to aviod combat, you can wear component on your head; cons: doesn't work on school staff fore some reason, If casted on self, you cannot wake up."
7. magnet - [add description here] [usable object]
8. rope - old tattered rope. You wouldn't trust it to hold you weight. But it's quite long. 
    I can't throw it too far but maybe I can grab something with a help of some spell?
9. potion - You recognise it from your alchemy classes (the only ones that you passes). This is a Far Jump Potion. You can use it to jump very far, but only once.
10. nightcap - It doesn't look too fashionable, but kind of comfy. [spell component]
11. sticky note - "The code is year of the Worm Spell disaster."
12. book spinnet - "There is more powerfull variant of "open" spell that uses rusty key as a component, which is proven to..." 
    The words "more", "powerful" and "rusty" are underlined and next to them there is a handwritten note "Dumb as hell".
13. big journal - "I finally decoded the runes on the wall. Some of them allow casting grow, shrink spells (grow(object). and shrink(object).).
    Others form some kind of a riddle. Good think that I listened during rune theory lectures. It roughly translates as:
        1. Red is the same size as Orange.
        2. Red has both small and big neighbour.
        3. Purple is small.
        4. Red and blue are both next to their colour mix.
        5. Their size has symmetry about the middle block.
        6. Blue doesn't have any small blocks on it's right.
        7. Red is more to the left than green is."
x. Beer - You are a student who failed an exam. There must be beer somewhere in the game.


To Do:
[add way to overcome acid puddle] done
[add nightcap somewhere] done
[add info about rusty key] done
[add info about grab spell] done

[create game winning scenarios] 3/3 done


Commands:
look                    - look around. Get room description
investigate(smth)              - investigate specyfic object. Get that object detailed description ex. read spell cheat sheet
go(dir) or n, s, w, e   - Move between rooms. Perhaps go(room_name) would automaticly move you to specyfic room if possible?
take(smth)              - add smth to inventory
inventory               - list items in inventory
use_object(smth1, smth2)       - use something on something ex. use(key, acid) to make key rusty



Spells:
You can cast spells to solve problems. To cast spell you need appropriate component. Player is not given spell list in the tutorial. They have to learn them in game.
syntax:
    cast(SPELLNAME, COMPONENT)
You usually can guess the component, but there will be spell cheat sheets in the dungeon (left by previous unlucky students).
spell list:
    cast(light, firefly)
    cast(open, rusty key)/ cast(open, key)  - wersion with rusty key is more powerfull and can open any door (perhaps also trapdoor in Beneth the trapdoor #2) 
    cast(grab, rope)                        - takes something from afar 
    cast(sleep, nightcap)
    cast(power_word_kill, smth)             - kills the fierce beast


Specyfic room mechanic:
    Junk room and items obscured by darkness
    Machinery and enter(1988) that creates magical bridge over acid pool
    use_object z potion w acid pool, to jump over the acid
    use_object w Beneath the trapdoor to reach it and escape the dungeon (but first the trapdoor must be open)
    Puzzle room grow, shrink and put

ideas for me:
    3 cobolds arguing about sandwich.
