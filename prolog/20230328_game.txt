The room has been instantaneously illuminated!
Now, when the light provides better visibility, you can distinguish various objects littering the floor.
One of them in particular draws your attention... a beige pile of something but you need to look closer to name it.
Now the possible exits are more clearly visible: three different passages leading north, east and west.

?- investigate(potion).
You recognise it from your alchemy classes (the only ones that you pass). This is a Far Jump Potion.
You can use it to jump very far, but only once.
true.

?- use_object(potion, trapdoor).
You take a sip from the bottle and spring into the air, hoping to reach the trapdoor.
You grab the edge of the opening and pull yourself up. You are finally free.

You did it. You made it out alive. 
There wasn't even a need of fighting the deadly beast. The escape through the trapdoor had some unforseen consequences though...
The University's magical database system was not capable of processing your way of escaping and spectacularly collapsed.
Personal data of many wizards and apprentices were lost. With the new-arisen chaos there is no way the High Wizard Council will let you continue studies.
Good think that your data was also lost. You can change your name, bluff your way through and retake the whole year. You seem like you need that anyway.

Thank you for playin our textgame.
